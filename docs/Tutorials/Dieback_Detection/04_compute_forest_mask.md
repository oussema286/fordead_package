#### Step 4 : Creating a forest mask, which defines the areas of interest

The harmonic model is adjusted for all pixels, but in our case only coniferous forests are of interest.
The export of dieback detection maps requires to filter out irrelevant areas. 

This steps aims at computing and writing a binary raster, then used as a 'forest mask'.
This can be done either by rasterizing a vector file, or by producing this binary mask directly. 
The final mask must have the same dimensions, spatial resolution, origin, and projection as Sentinel-2 images. 
It is also possible to run _fordead_ without any forest mask. 
Specific options allow taking advantage of land cover or forest spatial database available in France ([BDFORET](https://inventaire-forestier.ign.fr/spip.php?article646) from IGN and [Land cover](https://www.theia-land.fr/en/ceslist/land-cover-sec/) from THEIA).

Here, we used a shapefile identifying forested areas in the example dataset, which was rasterized as a binary raster.

Comprehensive documentation can be found [here](https://fordead.gitlab.io/fordead_package/docs/user_guides/english/04_compute_forest_mask/).

##### Running this step using a script

Run the following instructions to perform this processing step:

```python
from fordead.steps.step4_compute_forest_mask import compute_forest_mask

compute_forest_mask(data_directory, 
                    forest_mask_source = "vector", 
                    vector_path = "<MyWorkingDirectory>/vector/area_interest.shp")
```

##### Running this step from the command prompt

This processing step can also be performed from a terminal:

```bash
fordead forest_mask -o <output directory> -f vector --vector_path <MyWorkingDirectory>/vector/area_interest.shp
```
##### Outputs

The outputs of this step are stored in **data_directory**:
- In the folder **ForestMask**, the binary raster Forest_Mask.tif with the value 1 for pixels of interest, the value 0 elsewhere.

> **_NOTE :_** Though this step is presented as the fourth, it can actually be used at any point, even on its own in which case the parameter **path_example_raster** is needed to give a raster from which to copy the extent, resolution, etc...
