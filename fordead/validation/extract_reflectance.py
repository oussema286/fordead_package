        Path of a csv with the columns 'area_name','Date' and 'cloudiness', can be calculated by the [extract_cloudiness function](https://fordead.gitlab.io/fordead_package/docs/Tutorials/Validation/03_extract_cloudiness/). Can be ignored if sentinel_source is 'Planetary'
    lim_perc_cloud : float
        Maximum cloudiness at the tile scale, used to filter used SENTINEL dates. Between 0 and 1.
